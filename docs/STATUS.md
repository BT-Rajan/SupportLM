## Round log

### Round 0 — Planning
- Defined enterprise transformation scope across 8 phases (see
  `docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md` Section 3).
- Established `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` from the existing chat UI tokens
  as the canonical standard for every future screen.
- No application code changed this round.

## Open decisions / things to confirm before Phase 1 starts

- Multi-tenant isolation strategy: separate DB schema per tenant vs.
  shared schema with `tenant_id` row-level scoping. Recommendation to
  bring to Phase 1 kickoff: shared schema + `tenant_id` (simpler
  migrations, fine at current scale) unless the owner wants hard
  isolation for compliance reasons — flagged here, not yet decided.
- Usage tiers/plan limits: need the actual tier names/limits (e.g. doc
  count, messages/month, seats) before building enforcement — currently
  just listed as in-scope, not specified.
- Per-tenant branding: confirm whether this replaces the current
  hardcoded "Support" header or sits alongside a platform-default theme
  for tenants who don't customize.

## Next action

Start Phase 1, Round 1: multi-tenant schema design (tenant/org tables,
`tenant_id` scoping plan for existing `document`, `document_chunk`,
`conversation`, `message`, `citation` tables) — proposal first, then
migration + code once confirmed.
